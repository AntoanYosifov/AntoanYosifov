✏️ Ownership Logic – only the author of a destination can edit its description or delete it

📝 Reactive Forms & Validation – user-friendly forms with instant feedback

🔒 Route Guards – protect guest-only and auth-only routes with reactive streams

⚙️ Core Services – structured AuthenticationService & DestinationsService for clean, scalable logic
