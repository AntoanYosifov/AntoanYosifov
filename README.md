# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m currently studying Software Development at Software University (SoftUni).
- ðŸ”§ The work on the SPA version of my project is temporarily suspended due to my lack of frontend knowledge on which I'm working on. You can check the current versions here -> [BrainDissecting-Backend](https://github.com/AntoanYosifov/BrainDissecting) / [BrainDissecting-Frontend](https://github.com/AntoanYosifov/BrainDissecting-Front-End) SSR version here -> [BrainDissecting-SSR](https://github.com/AntoanYosifov/BrainDissecting-SSR-version)
- ðŸ“¬ You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoan-yosifov-b1b52026b/) or by [email](mailto:tapaktapxaomi@gmail.com).

Feel free to connect with me and check out my repositories!
