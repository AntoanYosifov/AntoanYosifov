### **TravelHub**

**TravelHub** is a dynamic web application where users can explore, share, and manage travel destinations in real time.

Real-time, collaborative SPA: Angular + Firebase (Firestore/Auth) for instant updates.

Reactive UX: Angular Signals + RxJS power live likes and lists without reloads.

Social mechanics: per-user single like rule, and a personal Want-to-Visit collection.

Auth & profiles: Firebase Auth with real-time profile edits.

Ownership & safety: only authors can edit/delete their destinations; route guards protect guest/auth areas.

Clean architecture: focused AuthenticationService and DestinationsService, Reactive Forms with validation.
